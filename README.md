# Sequence-Models
Gain better understanding of Sequence Models like RNN 

In this repository on sequence models, you will learn about the exciting field of deep learning that focuses on models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs). These models have transformed various areas such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. The repository will cover different examples where sequence models can be useful, including speech recognition, music generation, sentiment classification, DNA sequence analysis, machine translation, video activity recognition, and named entity recognition.
